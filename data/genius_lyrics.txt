Someone like you is hard to find
That's why I'm proud to say you're mine
When you make a mistake or two
I still will be so proud of you
You are too sweet and far too kind
You never truly left my mind
I love everything that you do
Just know this song was meant for you
Someone like you is hard to find
That's why I'm proud to say you're mine
When you make a mistake or two
I still will be so proud of you
You are too sweet and far too kind
You never truly left my mind
I love everything that you do
Just know this song was meant for you
Just know this song was meant for you
Someone like you is hard to find
That's why I'm proud to say you're mine
When you make a mistake or two
I still will be so proud of you
You are too sweet and far too kind
You never truly left my mind
I love everything that you do
Just know this song was meant for you
Someone like you is hard to find
That's why I'm proud to say you're mine
When you make a mistake or two
I still will be so proud of you
You are too sweet and far too kind
You never truly left my mind
I love everything that you do
Just know this song was meant for you
Just know this song was meant for you
