[Intro]
Go!
[Chorus]
You know how it goes
I try to be honest
Wi-Wish harm when you're harmless
I'm still with my day ones
We-we're smoking on chronic
Which one would you choose in, life or death? Come on, be honest
[Verse 1]
We got tanks, I'm not tryna wake up to some shit
We got bank, tryna put myself for life again (I'm tryna say)
Wh-Wh-What you tryna say?
My life could be worse, but yours could be replaced
"Don't be so hard on yourself"
Reason that I'm up, 'cause I go hard on myself
And back in 2020 was the hardest I felt
And if I fall from grace, then I don't want any help
I don't wanna play your speakers
°F sign meters
Nation leaders
Peace sign weaver
We go the same
We die, ascend
My rotten brain
They still don't know what to say

[Chorus]
You know how it goes
I try to be honest
Wi-Wish harm when you're harmless
I'm still with my day ones
We-We're smoking on chronic
Wh-Which one would you choose in, life or death? Come on, be honest
[Verse 2]
My eyes, I know they saw it through my eyes again, no big surprise
It's hard to run, it's hard to think, it's hard to stay alive
I do so many things at once and at the same damn time
And I don't know if in the end it's gonna pay off
I count up that bankroll
You said that you're next up, I don't think you know though
I might fuck around and make a dollar sign my logo
I don't like the fast life, so I'm living slow-mo
[Chorus]
I try to be honest
Still smoking on chronic
Life is so ironic
Go far, it's still nothing
Please, just to feel something
Burn bridges, no running (Ru-nning—)

[Outro]
(Running, running, running, I tried, I try)
(Running, running, running, I tried, I try)
(
You're running out of time!
)
