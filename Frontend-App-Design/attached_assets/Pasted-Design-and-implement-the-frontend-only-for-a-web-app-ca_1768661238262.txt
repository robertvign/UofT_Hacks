Design and implement the frontend only for a web app called Singmantic.
Do NOT create or assume any backend, APIs, databases, authentication, or server logic.
The project should be purely static / client-side UI with placeholder data and mock interactions.

Purpose & Identity:
Singmantic helps people reclaim and rekindle ancestral languages affected by colonization, using music as a bridge for learning, memory, and cultural continuity. The experience should feel hopeful, playful, and empowering.

Overall Visual Style (Very Important):

Inspired by Duolingo

Bright but soft colors

Rounded cards, buttons, and inputs

Friendly typography

Subtle hover and transition animations

Mobile-first and responsive

Pages to Build (Frontend Only):

1. Library Page (Main View)

Acts as the home screen

Displays a grid or list of song cards using mock data

Each song card includes:

Song title

Language name

Optional cultural/region tag

Play button (UI only, no real audio logic required)

Progress indicator (Duolingo-style ring, bar, or badge — visual only)

Layout should encourage exploration and joy, not performance pressure

2. Upload Page

Simple, friendly upload form (UI only)

Inputs:

MP3 file input (no real upload handling)

Song title text input

Language input (dropdown or free text)

Supportive explanatory copy such as:

“Sharing songs helps keep living languages alive.”

Mock success and error states using client-side state only

Clear primary CTA (e.g., “Add to Library”)

Functional Constraints (Important):

❌ No backend logic

❌ No authentication

❌ No API calls

❌ No database assumptions

✅ Use mock data and local UI state only

✅ Focus on layout, components, and interaction design

Technical Expectations:

React-based frontend (or equivalent)

Component-driven architecture

Clean, readable code

Tailwind or modern CSS preferred

Easy to later connect to a backend, but do not implement it now

The final result should feel like Duolingo’s warmth and delight applied to cultural language revival through music, delivered as a polished frontend prototype.
